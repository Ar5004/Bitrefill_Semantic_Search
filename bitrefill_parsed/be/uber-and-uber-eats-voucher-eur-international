Notes:
This is a voucher, not a gift card.Gift Cards add funds to your Wallet, while vouchers are a separate payment method altogether. These funds do not get applied to your Uber Wallet.The Vouchers always get used first as a payment method. If you apply a voucher, this will get used by default, rather than other payment methods you have enabled.The Vouchers are only supported on Mobile at the moment. The desktop mode currently doesn't support vouchers.
