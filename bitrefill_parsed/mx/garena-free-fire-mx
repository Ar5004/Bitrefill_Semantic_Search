Free Fire is a battle royale action title by Garena for iOS and Android.

Each 10 minute game will put you on a remote island with 49 other players looking to survive. Players can freely choose their starting point using their parachute and must stay in the safe zone for as long as possible. They can drive vehicles to explore the map, create strategies to hide or use objects to camouflage themselves in the grass.

Look good while you dominate your opponents with Free Fire Diamonds. Diamonds are used to buy in-game cosmetic items for your character & weapons.

Ambush and hunt, there is only one goal: to survive.
