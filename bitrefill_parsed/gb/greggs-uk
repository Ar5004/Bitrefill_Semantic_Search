Almost 80 years ago, John Gregg, with the help of his trusty push-bike, started delivering fresh eggs and yeast to the families of Newcastle. Ten years later he chained his bike up and opened his first shop - Greggs of Gosforth. Since then, Greggs have grown, opening over 2000 shops on high streets, retail parks, motorways, travel hubs and even drive-thrus. Not bad, right?

No, they’ve even got the Nations Favourite Bacon Roll, have won awards for going undercover at a food festival and are the 3rd biggest coffee seller in the UK. With freshly baked rolls, bakes and pizza, freshly prepared sandwiches, breakfast, coffee, pastas, fruit pots and sweet treats – Greggs really have something for everyone. 80 years of making people smile, and there’s plenty more where that came from.
