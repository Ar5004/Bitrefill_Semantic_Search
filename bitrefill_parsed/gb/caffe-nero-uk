Caffè Nero is a European coffee house brand specialising in the creation of high quality Italian coffee. Our philosophy is really very simple: Premium Italian coffee. A warm and welcoming atmosphere. Good food and great personal service. The core of our brand is our coffee.


We place great emphasis and spend large amounts of time and energy finding and buying the highest quality beans, and then having our craftsmen at our Roastery roast and blend our special, classic, award-winning, CaffèNero blend.


The Caffè Nero Gift Card can be used in over 550 Caffè Nero cafés across the UK. Here you will be able to enjoy our award winning range of Italian coffees, cold drinks, paninis, pastas, cakes, sandwiches and much more, in a warm and welcoming environment.
