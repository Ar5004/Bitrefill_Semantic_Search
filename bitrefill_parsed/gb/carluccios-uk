Carluccio’s began life in 1991 when Antonio and Priscilla opened their food shop in Neal Street, bringing the finest quality regional Italian food to London. In 1999 they opened the first Carluccio’s Caffè in Market Place - an authentic Italian restaurant in the truest sense of the word, and a continuation of their successful food shop. Today we have restaurants across the UK, open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and everything in between. Our menu changes every season and celebrates the best of regional Italian food, from spaghetti alle vongole to chicken milanese and tomato bruschetta. Every restaurant has a food shop and deli, selling gifts and ingredients all sourced from Italian producers - many of whom we have known for several generations.
