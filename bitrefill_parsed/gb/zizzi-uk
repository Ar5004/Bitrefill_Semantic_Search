We’ve opened more than 134 Italian Restaurants across the UK. Our aim? to stand out from the crowd. Each restaurant is a little bit different with a distinctly local feel, thanks to our ‘fresh talent’ collective of up and coming artist who help to create a unique atmosphere and dining experience. A dish will always come recommended, be it an Italian classic, an artisan inspired gelato or a freshly prepared local favourite. Zizzi currently has over 134 restaurants throughout the UK.
