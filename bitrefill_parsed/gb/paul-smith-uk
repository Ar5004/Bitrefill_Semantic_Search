Paul Smith is Britain’s foremost designer. He is renowned for his creative aesthetic, which combines tradition and modernity. Everything made by Paul Smith is designed in the UK from Paul Smith’s London headquarters, which is located a stone’s throw from Paul’s first London shop in Covent Garden. Reaffirming the values that Paul set down in 1970, ‘classic with a twist’ remains the guiding principle of the company.
