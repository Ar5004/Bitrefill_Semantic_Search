John Lewis & Partners began trading over 150 years ago in 1864 on London's Oxford Street, and is a leading omni-channel retailer in the UK with 50 John Lewis & Partners shops and a growing online business -johnlewis.com. 'Never Knowingly Undersold' has been our unique promise to our customers for over 75 years, on quality, service and value. You can trust that we will always stock the best quality products, responsibly sourced. If we find a national high street competitor offering a better nationwide price for the same individual product, sold with the same service conditions, we'll lower our price to match in all our shops and on our website, including when a competitor is having a sale.
