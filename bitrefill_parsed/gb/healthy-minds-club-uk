Working with a panel of certified and highly qualified experts, Healthy Minds Club understands what makes up and influences our mental health and has built a methodology which identifies the key elements which could become a problem, or that already exist. Once we have identified this, our mission is to connect our customers with the appropriate expert (or experts) to support the customer to build their own personal positive mental health and resilience toolkit.
