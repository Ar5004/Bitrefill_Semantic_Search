When you give a Starbucks Code, you’re giving more than just a gift or a token of appreciation. You’re connecting with customers and employees by providing them something that’s practical and meaningful from a widely-recognized brand. A Starbucks Code is appreciated in any amount – even smaller denominations. And it’s good for whatever they want – Starbucks beverages, pastries, whole bean coffee, coffee presses, CDs and more.
