We exist for the "girl in progress". Badass to the core, ever-evolving and growing, striving to be better every. damn. day. Flaws encouraged. Nasty Gal started in a tiny San Francisco apartment stacked with killer vintage, a single laptop and an eBay account. Thirteen years later, we’ve outgrown that apartment, moved to LA, and today we’re bigger and better than ever. We now carry new clothing, shoes and accessories under our own label–all for gals who know how to own it, and have the confidence to just be themselves.
