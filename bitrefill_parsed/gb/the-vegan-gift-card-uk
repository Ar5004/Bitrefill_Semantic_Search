Unlike traditional gift options, where you can simply pick something off the shelf, finding a suitable vegan gift requires careful consideration. You need to ensure that the product is free from animal products and by-products, and that it has not been tested on animals - the task can seem insurmountable, leaving you feeling lost and unsure of what to buy. Fortunately, with The Vegan Gift Card, you can give the gift of choice and allow your loved one to pick from a range of carefully selected vegan brands meaning they will end up with a gift that they love and more importantly that they can actually use. Buying gifts for a vegan friend or relative can be a tricky task.
